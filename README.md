# Contact List

### Install
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install`
- Build and run project

```
Write a simple "contact list" application.  The application should list contacts and allow users to add a new contact.  A "contact" is a person with a name, physical address, email address and phone number.

Please treat this as much like a "real" application as possible with the following exceptions:

1. Do not create a database. Instead you should persist the contacts in memory on the web server. (You SHOULD seed the application with an initial list of contacts.)
2. Do not worry about optimizing for download performance of HTML/JS/CSS/Image assets. Do whatever you find easiest.
3. Do not focus on design / UI. Feel free to use whatever styling, images, etc.. that you want, but know that design won't be a central focus of our review.
4. No user-centric documentation or manuals.



This application should be a single page web application written using the following technologies:
Visual Studio (Any version. Community Edition is fine)
- Angular 1.x
- ASP.NET MVC
- ASP.NET Web API
- C#
- JavaScript
```
